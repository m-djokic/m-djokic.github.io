    <p>I am interested in a lot of things like basketball. I played for the Red Devils BBC Linz club. Unfortunately
        there is no longer any training because of Corona. My favorite NBA team are the Golden State Warriors. My
        favorite player is Stephen Curry. He is also the best 3-point shooter. I'm also interested in gaming. My
        favorite games are FPS games, horror games and role-playing games. I also really enjoy watching anime. My
        favorite animes are: Tokyo Ghoul and Attack on Titan. Of course, I also like to listen to music. My favorite
        genres are rap, hip-hop and pop. I also listen to old rap from the 90's. The rappers I hear every day are: 2Pac,
        50Cent, Eminem and Pop Smoke.</p>
